# Surfs_up

# Project Overview
We are given a task to analyze the weather and precipitation levels on a Hawaiian island, Oahu. Our client, W. Avy wants to know whether or not it's a good idea to invest money in a Surf and Ice Cream Shop there.

The data analyze is important to W. Avy as some precipitation is necessary to create a favorable flora and environment, but too much precipitation would make us miss out on business opportunities for the store.
